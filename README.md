Here is my architecture choosed. I decided to work with Azure Cloud because I fell more comfortable with it and I have more experience. I choosed to start with Data Lake in Blob Storage, after that I built one pipeline with Azure Data Factory which I get all the files and insert them in Tables, and finally I created some queries with Azure SQL Database.
